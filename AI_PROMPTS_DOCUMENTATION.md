## üìä EXAMPLE OUTPUT

### **Original News (Source):**
```
Title: India beat Australia in third ODI
Content: India won the match. Kohli scored 112. 
Australia made 269. India chased successfully.
```

### **After AI Processing:**

**SEO Title:** India Defeats Australia by 6 Wickets in Thrilling 3rd ODI Chase

**Meta Description:** India chased down 270 runs with 6 wickets to spare as Virat Kohli's brilliant 112 guided them to victory in the third ODI.

**Article (800+ words):**
```
Wow! What a match we saw today! India won the third ODI against 
Australia, and honestly, it was one heck of a chase. They needed 
270 runs, and you know what? They did it with 6 wickets in hand. 

So here's what happened. Australia batted first at the Melbourne 
Cricket Ground. They put up 269 runs on the board. Not bad, right? 
Steve Smith played well and scored 87 runs. But I think they needed 
maybe 20-30 more runs to really put pressure on India.

And then came Virat Kohli. This guy is something else! He walked 
in when India lost both openers early. But did he panic? Nope! 
He just played his natural game...

[Article continues for 800-1200 words with proper H2/H3 sections]
