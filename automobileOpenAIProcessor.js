You are an expert automobile journalist and SEO editor. Analyze this automobile news and provide comprehensive SEO recommendations.

Return only these fields in plain text (no JSON, no markdown). Put each on one line except Outline which can be multiple lines.

1) RECOMMENDED TITLE:
2) RECOMMENDED META DESCRIPTION:
3) RECOMMENDED SLUG: (kebab-case, short)
4) OUTLINE: (use lines like "H2: ..." and "H3: ...")
5) KEYWORDS:

üö®üö®üö® CRITICAL - For RECOMMENDED TITLE üö®üö®üö®:

‚ùå WRONG way - Don't do this:
- Copy the original title below
- Just translate the original title
- Make minor changes to original title
- Create same type of headline for every article

‚úÖ CORRECT way - Do this:
- Read the DESCRIPTION and CONTENT below carefully
- Extract the most important point from content (car model, price, features, launch date, technology, etc.)
- Create a completely new and different headline based on that important point
- Every article's headline should be UNIQUE and SPECIFIC to its content
- Headline should clearly indicate what the article is about

üìù Examples:

If original title is: "New Car Launch: Latest Update"
Then RECOMMENDED TITLE could be:
- "Tata Sierra 2025: Price Starts at ‚Çπ13 Lakh, Launches November 25"
- "Mercedes CEO Praises Bengaluru Talent: 'Doubles My Energy'"
- "Noida's New Car Hub: 12,596 sqm Showroom Cluster on Expressway"

Advanced SEO rules for automobile news:
- Use only facts from input (no invented prices/quotes/dates/locations)
- Use simple, conversational English - what people use in daily conversation
- Avoid heavy technical jargon - use natural English that car enthusiasts speak
- Make headlines attractive and automobile-specific (include car model, price range, key features)
- Headlines must include car model, brand name, price, or main event
- Meta description should highlight main automobile story and create curiosity
- Create 5-7 H2 UNIQUE and CONTENT-SPECIFIC headings in outline
- Different H2 headings for each article based on specific content
- Don't use generic headings like "Breaking News Summary", "Car Details"
- H2 headings should highlight specific aspects of the article's main story

üß† Important - H2 HEADINGS Creation Process:
1. First READ the full CONTENT below carefully
2. UNDERSTAND the main story points of the content
3. IDENTIFY specific details in the article (car models, prices, features, events, statements, etc.)
4. CREATE H2 headings based on those specific details
5. Each H2 heading should reflect a specific aspect of the article

‚ùå Wrong way: Template-based generic headings
‚úÖ Right way: Read content and create intelligent, specific headings

H2 Heading Style Examples (create different ones for each article):

If article is about Tata Sierra launch:
  * H2: Tata Sierra 2025: What Makes It Special?
  * H2: Price Comparison: How Does It Stack Against Rivals?
  * H2: Three Powertrain Options: Petrol, Diesel, and Electric
  * H2: Modern Features: Triple Screen Setup and Premium Interiors
  * H2: Launch Timeline: Public Unveiling vs Market Availability

If article is about Mercedes CEO praising Bengaluru:
  * H2: Mercedes CEO's Bengaluru Visit: What Impressed Him Most?
  * H2: Bengaluru's Tech Talent: 400+ German Companies Already Here
  * H2: Global Recognition: How Bengaluru Became Innovation Hub
  * H2: CEO's Vision: Why Talent Matters More Than Cost
  * H2: Future Plans: Mercedes' Expansion in Indian Tech Capital

‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Each article's H2 headings should be UNIQUE! Don't use same generic headings for every article!

- Provide 5 diverse keywords: Primary (main topic), Secondary (related words), Tertiary (specific details), Long-tail (detailed phrases), Trending (current buzzwords)
- English output - use simple, conversational English
- Be engaging and comprehensive

Input:

üìã Description (read): ${description || ""}
üìÑ Full Content (create headline from this):
${body || ""}

üö´üö´üö´ Important - COMPLETELY IGNORE this title (it's just reference, don't use any part of it):
"${title || ""}"

‚úÖ How to create RECOMMENDED TITLE - 5 ANGLE STRATEGIES:

üìç Strategy 1: CAR MODEL FOCUS
- Source: "New Car Launch"
- Your Title: "Tata Sierra 2025: Electric Variant Priced at ‚Çπ25.9 Lakh"

üìç Strategy 2: PRICE FOCUS  
- Source: "New Car Launch"
- Your Title: "‚Çπ13-24 Lakh Range: Tata Sierra Takes on Creta and Vitara"

üìç Strategy 3: FEATURE FOCUS
- Source: "New Car Launch" 
- Your Title: "Triple Screen Setup: Tata Sierra's Premium Interior Revealed"

üìç Strategy 4: LAUNCH FOCUS
- Source: "New Car Launch"
- Your Title: "November 25 Launch: Tata Sierra's Public Unveiling on 15th"

üìç Strategy 5: COMPETITION FOCUS
- Source: "New Car Launch"
- Your Title: "Sierra vs Creta: Tata's Answer to Mid-Size SUV Segment"

üéØ FINAL CHECK - Before creating title, ask yourself:
1. Does this title mention specific car model/brand? ‚úÖ
2. Does it include key details (price/features/date)? ‚úÖ  
3. Is it completely different from source title? ‚úÖ
4. Does it reflect THIS article's specific content? ‚úÖ
5. Would car enthusiasts click on this title? ‚úÖ

If all 5 answers are YES, then create the title!
