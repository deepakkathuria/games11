  title: "Shubman Gill rejected for India's Test captaincy, Jasprit Bumrah emerges as 'automatic choice'",
  body: `
Former Indian batter and cricket specialist Wasim Jaffer has dropped his bold take on India‚Äôs next captain in Test cricket on social media. Jaffer backed Jasprit Bumrah as the best man to lead the Indian cricket team in Tests, calling him the automatic choice unless the pacer himself says no.

After Rohit Sharma‚Äôs retirement from the longest format of the game, the Indian selectors are in a dilemma about selecting the right candidate to lead the side. There are reports that the BCCI and the selectors are looking at the Gujarat Titans captain, Shubman Gill, as India‚Äôs next Test captain.

Wasim Jaffer picks Jasprit Bumrah over Shubman Gill as India‚Äôs next Test captain
Gill led India in the T20Is, and he is even the vice-captain of the national team in the ODIs, but his sudden rise in leadership at the international arena without any substantial experience left many worried, including Wasim Jaffer, especially when the team has options like Bumrah.

The ace Indian pacer has led India in three Tests and has been serving as the vice-captain in the format, but few reports suggest that he is not in contention for the full-time captaincy due to the history of his injuries, as they feel his presence in the XI is much more important than leadership.

Contrary to the background noise, Jaffer wants the BCCI to hand over India‚Äôs Test captaincy to Bumrah despite Shubman Gill being seen as a future leader. The former Indian batter believes that Gill should be made vice-captain and step in when Bumrah takes a break.

Jasprit Bumrah is an automatic captaincy choice: Wasim Jaffer
This will help the Gujarat Titans captain to continue learning while Bumrah leads the charge. The cricket pundit feels Bumrah being Test captain would prepare Gill for future leadership without the burden of full-time responsibility too early.

Wasim Jaffer posted, X: ‚ÄúI think Bumrah is an automatic captaincy choice, unless he doesn't want the responsibility. He should be the captain with Gill as VC‚Äîstepping in whenever Bumrah needs rest. This way Gill could also be groomed without the pressure of being the full-time captain.‚Äù

Shubman Gill set to become India‚Äôs next Test captain after secret lunch with Gautam Gambhir
Meanwhile, according to a report by the Times of India, Shubman Gill recently met Gautam Gambhir at his home in Delhi for lunch. They reportedly have discussions for four to five hours, and it's now almost certain that Gill will be named India‚Äôs next Test captain.

The report further claimed that Gill also met Indian chief selector Ajit Agarkar at Wankhede Stadium after the IPL 2025 match between Gujarat Titans and Mumbai Indians in Mumbai. Since the selectors want a long-term captain, Gill looks like a perfect option for them in the Tests.

Interestingly, Gambhir reportedly brought back Shardul Thakur and Ishan Kishan into the Test scenes, as the two players are almost certain to be picked in India A's squad for the upcoming England tour. The first India A vs. England Lions match is scheduled to be played on May 30.
